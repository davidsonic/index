  <h2>Abstract</h2>

  <div id="coursedesc">
<p>In this paper, we focus on isolated gesture recognition and explore different modalities by involving
RGB stream, depth stream and saliency stream for inspection. Our goal is to push the boundary of this
realm even further by proposing a unified framework which exploits the advantages of multi-modality
fusion. Specifically, a spatial-temporal network architecture based on consensus-voting has been pro-
posed to explicitly model the long term structure of the video sequence and to reduce estimation vari-
ance when confronted with comprehensive inter-class variations. In addition, a 3D depth-saliency con-
volutional network is aggregated in parallel to capture subtle motion characteristics. Extensive experi-
ments are done to analyze the performance of each component and our proposed approach achieves the
best results on two public benchmarks–ChaLearn IsoGD and RGBD-HuDaAct, outperforming the clos-
est competitor by a margin of over 10% and 15% respectively.</p>

  <h2>Gesture Recognition Framework</h2>
 <p> Below is an overview of the proposed AVC face detection method. It includes
three main steps in the detection phase: visible component detection step, local
region competition step, and the local to global aggregation step. AVC works
by detecting only the visible components which would be later aggregated to
represent the whole face.</p>
<p>Two half-view facial component detectors are trained,
and for this we introduce a pose-invariant component definition via a regression
based local landmark alignment, which is crucial for training sample cropping
and pose-invariant component detection. Then the two learned detectors are
mirrored to detect the other half view of the facial components. Next, the de-
tected visible facial components go through a local region competition module to alleviate false detections, and finally a local to global aggregation strategy is
applied to detect the whole face adaptively.

 <h2>Pose-invariant Component Mapping</h2>
  <p>Samples in AFLW consist of 21 landmarks. We first calculate the mean shape
of the whole database with samples normalized and missing coordinates excluded. Region in the mean shape which we want to map ie. left eyebrow and left
eye for LE component is mapped directly to a new input sample by applying the
transformation</p>

<p>Closed form solution can be derived as the following:</p>

<br><br>
<p>An intuitive visual interpretation is shown below, blue points are
annotated landmarks while red points are mapped from meanshape. Positive
samples extracted in this way retain excellent uniformity, which would be used
for training LE and LM component detector. </p>

<br><br>
<p>The pose-invariant component
mapping method is also used for preparing negative samples for bootstrapping</p>

<h2>Training procedure</h2>
<p><b>Feature:</b> We choose NPD as our feature mainly for its two properties:
illumination invariant and fast in speed because each computation involves only
two pixels. For an image with size p = w × h , the number of features computed
is C p 2 which can be computed beforehand, leading to superiority in speed for
real world applications. With the scale-invariance property of NPD, the facial
component detector is expected to be robust against illumination changes which
is important in practice.</p>

<p><b>Training framework:</b> The Deep Quadratic Tree (DQT) is used as
weak classifier which learns two thresholds and is deeper compared to typical
tree classifiers. Soft-Cascade as well as hard-negative mining are applied for
cascade training. While individual NPD features may be ”weak”, the Gentle
AdaBoost algorithm is utilized to learn a subset of NPD features organized in
DQT for stronger discriminative ability.</p>

<h2>Local to Global Aggregation</h2>
<p><b>Symmetric Component Detection:</b> Below shows some example outputs by LE and LM detector respectively. As can be seen, our component-based detector has the inherent advantages under occa-
sions of occlusions and pose-variations, where a holistic
detector would normally fail. The detection of right eyebrow + right eye (RE)
and right mouth + right nose (RM) can be achieved by deploying the detector
of their left counterpart.</p>
<br><br>
  <div style="width:100%; text-align:center;">
	<img src="accv/symmetric.png" style="width:60%">
  </div>
<br><br>
<p><b>Local Region Competition:</b> The core
idea is to reject false alarms during merging (compete) while improving localization accuracy during aggregation (collaborate).</p>
<p><b>Aggregation Strategy:</b> After deploying competitive strategy to exclude possible false positives, the task
now is to ensure accurate localization of detection outputs. This is achieved by
taking the full use of information from rects of different regions. We use rectangle
as facial representation. Note that our proposed pipeline also applies to elliptical
representation as the aforementioned workflow remains unchanged. (<a href="accv/local_region.png">diagram</a>)</p>
<h2>Experimental Results</h2>
<p><b>AFW Result:</b> We compare
AVC with both academic methods like DPM, HeadHunter, Structured Models
and commercial systems like Face++ and Picasa. As can be seen from the figure,
AVC outperforms DPM and is superior or equal to Face++ and Google Picasa.
The precision of AVC is 98.68% with a recall of 97.13%, and the AP of AVC is
98.08%, which is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods. Example detec-
tion results are shown in the first row of Fig 8, note that we output rectangle
for evaluation on AFW. </p>

<p><b>FDDB Result:</b> We compare our results with the latest published methods on FD-
DB including MTCNN, DP2MFD, Faceness-Net and Hyperface. Ours performs
worse than MTCNN and DP2MFD which resort to powerful yet complex CN-
N features but is better than Faceness-Net, which is also component-based but
with the help of CNN structure. AVC gets 84.4% detection rate at FP=100, and a detection rate of 89.0% at FP=300. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this paper, we proposed a new method called AVC highlighting component-
based face detection, which addresses pose variations and occlusions simultane-
ously in a single framework with low complexity. We show a consistent compo-
nent definition which helps to achieve pose-invariant component detection. To
handle facial occlusions, we only detect visible facial components, and build a
local to global aggregation strategy to detect the whole face adaptively. Exper-
iments on the FDDB and AFW databases show that the proposed method is
robust in handling illuminations, occlusions and pose-variations, achieving much
better performance but lower model complexity compared to the corresponding
holistic face detector. The proposed face detector is able to output local facial
components as well as meanshape landmarks, which may be helpful in landmark
detection initialization and pose estimation. We will leave it as future work for
investigation.</p>
