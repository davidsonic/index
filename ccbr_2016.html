  <h2>Abstract</h2>

  <div id="coursedesc">
<p>Face detection evaluation generally involves three steps: block
generation, face classification, and post-processing. However, firstly, face
detection performance is largely influenced by block generation and post-
processing, concealing the performance of face classification core mod-
ule. Secondly, implementing and optimizing all the three steps results
in a very heavy work, which is a big barrier for researchers who only
cares about classification. Motivated by this, we conduct a specialized
benchmark study in this paper, which focuses purely on face classifica-
tion. We start with face proposals, and build a benchmark dataset with
about 3.5 million patches for two-class face/non-face classification. Re-
sults with several baseline algorithms show that, without the help of
post-processing, the performance of face classification itself is still not
very satisfactory, even with a powerful CNN method. </p>

<p>The data and evaluation code of this study will be released to the public
to help assess performance of face classification, and ease the participation of
related researchers who want to try their algorithms for face detection. With this
benchmark, researchers only need to do feature extraction and face classification
per image patch, regardless the troubling block generation and post-processing
tasks. Even more easily, we provide some baseline features, so that general clas-
sification researchers are able to evaluate their classification algorithms.</p>

  <h2>Performance of RPN network</h2>
 <p> RPN network is employed to extract proposals inspired by the work of Faster
R-CNN and its recent application in face detection. Note that generic
object proposal-generating methods are not very suitable for our
classification benchmark because the amount of positive face patches generated
is too scarce and those patches are not as discriminative as a specially trained
RPN face proposal network.</p>
<p>We trained a 4-anchor RPN network with some slight modifications on the fc6
and fc7 InnerProduct layer of Zeiler and Fergus model. The default anchor
ratio was set to 1:1 and we compute anchors at 4 different scales (2,8,16,32). Dur-
ing training, the number of categories are modified to 2 (face and background)
with 2*4 bounding box coordinates to be predicted. Softmax and smoothL1 loss
are deployed for training classification and bounding box prediction respectively.
</p>
<p>  The performance of RPN is evaluated on AFW database, through ROC curve. </p>

 <h2>Face Classification Benchmark</h2>
  <p>All the proposals are generated from the training set of WIDER FACE
containing 12,880 high-resolution images through this RPN convolutional neural
network. There are about 300 proposals extracted from each image. WIDER
FACE contains 393,703 labelled faces collected from 32,203 images with a wide
variety in scales, poses, occlusions and expressions. As shown in Table 1, proposals are extracted from the first 6,440 images in
WIDER FACE are used as the training set, while the remaining proposals from
the next 6,440 images are used as testing set. In the testing set the size of Non-
face patches are about 20 times the size of face proposals.</p>
<br>
<div style="width:100%; margin-left:30%;">
<img src="ccbr/table1.jpg" style="width:40%">
</div>
<br>
<p>In our benchmark dataset, when the Intersection over Union (IOU) between
a face proposal generated by RPN and a ground-truth label is greater than 0.5,
we treat it as a face patch. Otherwise, when the IOU is below 0.3, we treat it as a
non-face patch. As a result, we collected a face classification benchmark (FCB)
database, which contains 3,558,142 proposals in total, of which 198,616 being
face patches. All images are resized to 24x24 for face classification benchmark.
Note that by doing so there may be some changes to the original aspect ratio.</p>

 <p>Below are some sample patches of the proposed face classification benchmark.</p>

<h2>Evaluation and Results</h2>
<p><b>Traditional Methods:</b> Illumination changes, occlusions and pose variation-
s are three fundamental problems for face detection under unconstrained set-
tings. Illumination-invariance is obtained in LOMO by applying the Retinex
transform and the Scale Invariant Local Ternary Pattern (SILTP) for feature
representation. NPD gives the nice properties of scale-invariance, bounded-
ness and its feature involves only two pixel values, hence robust to occlusion
and blur or low image resolution. We use the open source code of these two
feature representation methods in our experiments. Besides, LBP together
with its variant MB-LBP are also re-implemented for evaluation. We adopt
DQT+boosting as our baseline classifier. We also tried SVM, but it appears
to be not effective to handle this challenging problem, and it is also not efficient
for our large-scale data. Therefore, we leaved SVM out finally.</p>

<p><b>CNN Methods:</b> Convolutional Neural Network based methods have re-
ceived more and more attention due to its effectiveness in computer vision tasks.
In our experiments, a CIFAR-10 Net based binary classification CNN and a
Cascade-CNN following the paradigm of have been implemented.
Several CNN structures have been explored and we picked one with the best
performance based on CIFAR-10 and its detailed information is listed in Table 2.
As for the structure of Cascade-CNN. Note that for training Cascade-CNN, hard negative samples mined by the former net are used as non-
face samples to be used for the following net training and in training each net,
hard positive samples mined are aggregated to face proposals for further fine-
tuning.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Face detection generally involves three steps with face classification being its
core module. However, it is not easy to determine the actual performance of the
face classification part due to the large influence of block generation and post-
processing in traditional benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a special-
ized benchmark study in this paper, which focuses purely on face classification.
We start with face proposals by collecting about 3.5 millions of face and non-face
sample patches, and build a benchmark dataset (FCB) for two-class face classi-
fication evaluation. Our results show that, without the help of post-processing,
the performance of face classification itself is still not very satisfactory, even with
a powerful CNN method. The data and evaluation code of this study will be re-
leased to the public to help assess performance of face classification, and ease
the participation of other related researchers who want to try their algorithms
for face detection.</p>
